**Repo for kotlin codes and programs.**

## 1) Todo App (App Box):

First Android application made with Kotlin, a simple todo app. It is able to add new notes to a list of Todo's. This is a weekend project I made with my girlfriend's little brother.

### Future improvements:
- ~~Change ListView to the new RecyclerView structure;~~
- ~~Delete an item from the list;~~
- Fix bug of deleting out of order and leave the last item "undeleteable".
- Expand the view of an item, maybe to edit, or to see an image attached to it;
- settings to increase font size;
