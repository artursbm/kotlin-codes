# Learning Kotlin

These files comes from the course ["Kotlin for Java Developers"](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-for-java-developers/), which I'm using to learn Kotlin.

There are examples of data types, variable declarations, object comparisons, and how classes works, as well as how the whole Kotlin language works.
